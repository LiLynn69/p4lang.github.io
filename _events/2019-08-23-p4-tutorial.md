### Held at Shangri-La Hotel Beijing on Friday, August 23, 2019 

### [Register Here!](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2019/registration.html)

### Expectations 

Attendees will be expected to have basic familiarity with the P4 lanaguage. Novice participants without any prior P4 experience are encouraged to refer to the Getting Started wiki page.

Attendees will also be expected to bring their own laptops. We will provide a VM image containing all the necessary packages and tools. The P4 specification is publicly available at the P4 website under an Apache license. Key development tools (front-end compiler and software switch capable of running P4 programs) are available as open-source tools ([http://github.com/p4lang](http://github.com/p4lang)).

### Instructions

In order to ensure that you arrive prepared for the tutorial we ask that you please follow the instructions listed on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/sigcomm19).

If you attend and complete the P4 tutorial and you would like to receive a certificate of completion from P4.org, please send an email to sibanez@stanford.edu indicating your request.
