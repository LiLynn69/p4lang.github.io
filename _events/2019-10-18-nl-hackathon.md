### An event organized by the P4 Education Working Group
    
#### Held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands on October 18th, 2019

The P4 Hackathon aims to develop novel, proof-of-concept data plane applications, and to support the open-source community through the development of tools and infrastructure.

The hackathon is intended for P4 users of all levels - from beginners to experts. We are keen to meet new people, see new faces, and create new collaborations between (and within) academia and industry!
