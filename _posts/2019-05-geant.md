[Phase 3](https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT_Project_GN4-3/Pages/Home.aspx)
of the GÉANT4 project is exploring questions related to white box
programmability through two activities: RARE (Router for Academic,
Research &amp; Education) and DPP (Data Plane Programmability). RARE
is investigating how a Network Operating System controlling
P4-programmable data planes can be used to implement Research &amp;
Education use cases with advanced network features. DPP is developing sophisticated network monitoring and security analyses (DDoS identification and
mitigation) using FPGAs and programmable ASICs. 

Further details can be found on the
[webpage](https://wiki.geant.org/display/SIGNGN/2nd+SIG-NGN+Meeting)
for a white-boxing workshop, which was held on April 4-5 in Stockholm.
